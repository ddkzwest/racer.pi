# Racer.pi

_WIP_

My grandpa is the coolest man alive. He is a retired master electrical engineer. In his free time, he builds pinewood derby cars and iterates over his models to build the fastest wooden car you'll ever see. He built a track that times each race using nothing but hardware. He does complex logic in circuits that would be easier for most to code.

Talking with him, I decided that it would be awesome to hook up his system to a raspberry pi for more advanced usage.

We hope by the end to be able to record each race and display the results live on a web server hosted from the raspberry pi.

_Stay tuned for a super cool multi-generational project._
